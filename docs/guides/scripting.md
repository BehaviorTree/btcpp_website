# Introduction to Scripting

Behavior Tree 4.X introduces a simple but powerful new concept:
a scripting language within XML.

The implemented scripting language has a familiar syntax; it allows the user to quickly
read from / write to the variables of the blackboard.

The simpler way to learn how scripting works is using the built-in action __Script__,
which was introduced in the [second tutorial](tutorial-basics/tutorial_02_basic_ports.md)

## Assignment operators, strings and numbers

Example:

```
param_A := 42
param_B = 3.14
message = 'hello world'
```

- The first line assigns the number 42 to the blackboard entry __param_A__.
- The second line assigns the number 3.14 to the blackboard entry __param_B__.
- The third line assigns the string "hello world" to the blackboard entry __message__.

:::tip
The difference between the operator __":="__ and __"="__ is that the former
may create a new entry in the blackboard, if it doesn't exist, whilst the latter will throw
an exception if the blackboard doesn't contain the entry.
:::

You can also use __semicolons__ to add multiple
commands in a single script.

```
A:= 42; B:=24
```

### Arithmetic operators and parenthesis 

Example:

```
param_A := 7
param_B := 5
param_B *= 2
param_C := (param_A * 3) + param_B
```

The resulting values of `param_B` is 10 and `param_C` is 31. 

The following operators are supported:

| Operator | Assign Operator  | Description |
|----------|---------|---------|
| +        |  +=     | Add      |
| -        |  -=     | Subtract |
| *        |  *=     | Multiply |
| /        |  /=     | Divide   |

Note that the addition operator is the only one that also works with string (used to concatenate two strings).

## Bitwise operator and hexadecimal numbers

These operators work only if the value can be cast to
an integer number.

Using them with a string or real number will
cause an exception.

Example:

```
value:= 0x7F
val_A:= value & 0x0F
val_B:= value | 0xF0
```

The value of `val_A` is 0x0F (or 15); `val_B` is 0xFF (or 255). 

| Binary Operators | Description |
|----------|---------|
| \|       |  Bitwise or   |
| &        |  Bitwise and |
| ^        |  Bitwise xor |

| Unary Operators | Description |
|----------|---------|
| ~        |  Negate   |

## Logic and comparison operators

Operators which return a boolean.

Example:

```
val_A := true
val_B := 5 > 3
val_C := (val_A == val_B)
val_D := (val_A && val_B) || !val_C
```

| Operators | Description |
|----------|---------|
| true/false |  Booleans. Castable to 1 and 0 respectively   |
| &&       |  Logic and |
| \|\|     |  Logic or |
| !        |  Negation |
| ==       |  Equality |
| !=       |  Inequality |
| <        |  Less |
| <=       |  Less equal |
| >        |  Greater |
| >=       |  Greater equal |


### Ternary operator **if-then-else**

Example:

```
val_B = (val_A > 1) ? 42 : 24
```

## C++ example

Demonstration of the scripting language, including how to use enums to 
represent **integer values**.

The XML:

``` xml
<root >
    <BehaviorTree>
        <Sequence>
            <Script code=" msg:='hello world' " />
            <Script code=" A:=THE_ANSWER; B:=3.14; color:=RED " />
            <Precondition if="A>B && color!=BLUE" else="FAILURE">
                <Sequence>
                  <SaySomething message="{A}"/>
                  <SaySomething message="{B}"/>
                  <SaySomething message="{msg}"/>
                  <SaySomething message="{color}"/>
                </Sequence>
            </Precondition>
        </Sequence>
    </BehaviorTree>
</root>
```

The C++ code to register the Nodes and the enums:

``` cpp
int main()
{
  // Simple tree: a sequence of two asynchronous actions,
  // but the second will be halted because of the timeout.

  BehaviorTreeFactory factory;
  factory.registerNodeType<SaySomething>("SaySomething");

  enum Color { RED=1, BLUE=2, GREEN=3 };
  // We can add these enums to the scripting language
  factory.registerScriptingEnums<Color>();

  // Or we can do it manually
  factory.registerScriptingEnum("THE_ANSWER", 42);

  auto tree = factory.createTreeFromText(xml_text);
  tree.tickWhileRunning();
  return 0;
}
```

Expected output:

```
Robot says: 42.000000
Robot says: 3.140000
Robot says: hello world
Robot says: 1.000000
```

Note as, under the hood, an ENUM is always interpreted as its numerical value.
