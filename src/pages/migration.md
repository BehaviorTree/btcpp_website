# Migrating from version 3.X to 4.X

You will find that most of the changes in version 4.X
are incremental and back compatible with your previous code.

Here we try to summarize the most relevant difference 
that you should be aware of, when migrating.

## Class renaming 

The name of the following classes / XML tags changed.

| Name in 3.8+ | Name in 4.x | Where |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| NodeConfiguration | NodeConfig | C++ |
| SequenceStar | SequenceWithMemory | C++ and XML |
| AsyncActionNode | ThreadedAction | C++ |
| Optional | Expected | C++ |

If you want to quickly fix the compilation of your C++ code, **even if refactoring is encorauged**, do:

```cpp
namespace BT 
{
  using NodeConfiguration = NodeConfig;
  using AsyncActionNode = ThreadedAction;
  using Optional = Expected;
}
```

:::info
These changes can be disabled while compiling BT.CPP with the CMake option __USE_V3_COMPATIBLE_NAMES__.
:::

## SubTree and SubTreePlus

The deafault **SubTree** in 3.X has been deprecated and
**SubtreePlus** is the new default, being easier to use and 
more consistent.

| Name in 3.8+ | Name in 4.x |
|-------------|---------|
| `<SubTree>` | Deprecated |
| `<SubTreePlus>` | `<SubTree>` |

## SetBlackboard and BlackboardPrecondition

The new [scripting language](/docs/tutorial-advanced/scripting)
is much simpler and more powerful.

Old code in **3.8+**:

``` xml
<SetBlackboard output_key="port_A" value="42" />
<SetBlackboard output_key="port_B" value="69" />
<BlackboardCheckInt value_A="{port_A}" value_B="{port_B}" 
                    return_on_mismatch="FAILURE">
    <MyAction/>
</BlackboardCheckInt>
```

New code in **4.X**:

``` xml
<Script code="port_A:=42; port_B:=69" />
<Precondition if="port_A==port_B" else="FAILURE">
    <MyAction/>
</Precondition>
```

## Preemptable Nodes and Tree::tickRoot()

A serious problem was detected by a user 
[here](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP/issues/395):

> If a **ControlNode** or **DecoratorNode** has synchronous children only,
it is impossible to interrupt it.

Consider this example:

```xml
<ReactiveSequence>
    <AbortCondition/>
    <Sequence name="synch_sequence">
        <SyncActionA/>
        <SyncActionB/>
        <SyncActionC/>
    <Sequence>
</ReactiveSequence>   
```

:::danger
Once the Sequence "synch_sequence" starts, with BT.CPP 3.X
it is impossible for **AbortCondition** to stop it.
:::

In BT.CPP 4.X we modified our Controls and Decorators to
prevent this potential issue.

Now, when a Synchronous child is executed, **RUNNING is returned** before moving to the next child.
In this way, we give the opportunity to the tree to check ReactiveSequences or other Conditions.  

From a practical point of view, this means that we must call **tick()** more often.

:::tip
This new behavior should NOT introduce any additional latency, at least not a significant one.

When Controls and Decorator return RUNNING, the method `Tree::sleep()` will **not**
block and won't introduce any additional delay. This is the reason why you should never use 
"normal" sleep functions.
:::

To make this new behavior more explicit, the method `Tree::tickRoot()` was removed,
and we introduce these two new methods instead:

- `Tree::tickOnce()` works as usual. It should run inside a while-loop.
- `Tree::tickWhileRunning()` has its own while-loop, and will continue ticking until either 
SUCCESS or FAILURE is received.
